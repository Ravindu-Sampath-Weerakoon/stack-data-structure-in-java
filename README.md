This repository is a resource to facilitate learning about the stack data structure in Java.

## What is the Stack Data Structure?

The stack is a fundamental data structure that adheres to the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Simply put, the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Visualize it as a collection of elements with two primary operations:

- **Push:** Adding an item to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removing the item from the top of the stack.

Additionally, stacks often provide a way to peek at the top element without removing it.

## Contents

This repository includes Java code examples and explanations to aid in comprehending and implementing a stack data structure. The code is organized into the following files:

- **Stack.java:** The main implementation of the stack.
- **StackNode.java:** A class representing a node in the stack.
- **DriverForStack.java:** A driver program demonstrating the usage of the stack.

This resource is designed to help you grasp the concepts of stack implementation in Java.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to enhance the learning experience!
